Visit https://ackmanx.github.io/ for site

Any changes to `main` branch for the Github remote will be automatically deployed within a couple minutes and `/docs` is the page hosted

Other files aren't hosted, but this is a public repository, so...

While hosting (and the name) is specific to Github, I still keep the repository with Codeberg as the default remote
